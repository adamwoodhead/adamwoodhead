# Adam Woodhead

UK-based Laravel/PHP engineer & integration architect. I build reliable API integrations, job/queue-driven automation, and ESB-style systems with a bias for clarity, observability, and maintainable code.

## What I'm working on
- **Modern Networks ESB** - integration platform with load balancing, AI-assisted workflows, 20+ connected systems, and heavy job/queue execution
- **ResTech** - internal platform for my own company: tickets, CRM, documents, finance/accounting, and end-to-end automations

## Core strengths
- Designing integration flows that survive real-world failure modes (retries, idempotency, backoff, reconciliation)
- Building clean, readable Laravel architectures with strong domain boundaries
- Operational sanity: logging, metrics, traceability, and debuggable deployments

## Tech I use
Laravel • PHP • MySQL • Redis • Docker • Linux • Nginx  
Queues/Workers • APIs/Webhooks • ETL-style pipelines • LLM tooling (pragmatic, not gimmicky)

## Selected work
- **Modern Networks ESB** - multi-system orchestration, routing, and automation at scale (job/queue-first)
- **ResTech** - unified ops platform: tickets, finance, accounting, docs, CRM, automation

## Principles
- Build for failure: assume retries, partial outages, and weird data
- Prefer simple, explicit code over clever abstractions
- Make it observable: if it breaks, it should be easy to explain why
